For this project, I am building an Arcade Game.
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling and JS for the main Engine. 

I am making the player and enemies move and interact in the canvas.

# How to play
 In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.
 
The player can move left, right, up and down
The enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board
Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square.

Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won. 

The player has 3 lives.
The player loses one life everytime he/she collides with and enemy! 

When winning the player earn an extra life!
